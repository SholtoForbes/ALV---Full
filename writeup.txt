ALV-2 Trajectory Optimisation Program

created by Sholto Forbes-Spyratos in Octave


This program optimises the trajectory of the ALV-2 over all three stages using a single shooting method, solved in an SQP solver.





Single Shooting Method

The single shooting method is the simplest optimal control technique. The single shooting method discretises the controls into defined segments, 
and numerically integrates the ALV-2 dynamics using these controls as inputs. These controls are then modified until an optimal trajectory is found. 
The simplest example of the shooting method is maximising the distance of a cannon ball by selecting the optimal shooting angle! This would be a single shooting method with 
only 1 control input, whereas rocket control requires many as the control must change over time.  

Image takes from slides by Moritz Diehl, can be found as first result by googling 'single shooting diehl'.

Solving for multiple control inputs becomes very complicated, and is carried out by a Sequential Quadratic Programming solver, which is a standard solver in most programming languages. Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP)
is a generic process by which a system can be optimised, by minimising a certain function f(x) subject to a set of controls u(x) and constraints g(x) = 0 and h(x)>=0. 
For a single shooting approach, SQP provides the maximum velocity attainable at orbit by selecting an optimal range of discretised controls, subject to the dynamics of the ALV-2 system. 






 The Program

The optimisation program will find a sequence of angle of attack values at discrete timepoints to reach a given altitude, at 0 degree trajectory inclination, with maximum velocity. Note that this does not 
mean that the ALV-2 will necessarily achieve orbital velocity! 
These angle of attack values are transitioned between using linear tangent guidance.

Inputs:
Launch Location
Target Altitude
2nd, 3rd Stage Node Spacing - This is the separation of the nodes of discretised control. ie. the control will be constant for intervals of this value (see Single Shooting Method). 
				Making this smaller will result in higher accuracy, but longer computation time. Numerical instability can result from having this be too small OR too large! But there is no hard and fast rule to follow, if in doubt leave the default values.
prepitch Time - The time of flight before pitching (s)
Pitchover Angle - Specified pitch angle (deg)
Guess - Initial guess of pitch change rate to provide to the SQP solver, 'Auto' will run a range of constant pitch change rates and choose the end result closest to the desired altitude as an initial guess



During the program runtime, the current stage of simulation will be printed, along with the altitude achieved at the end of each simulation step, which can be used as a general guide to how the optimiser is doing. 
This will most of the time be repeated values, this is normal for an SQP optimiser.
